Background
---------------
* The EdTech industry has been surging in the past decade, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.26% from 2018 to 2023.
* Due to the industry's rapid growth and the attraction of new customers, new companies have emerged in the industry. 
* These new companies can reach out to a wider audience with the availability and ease of use of digital marketing resources.

Project Goal
-----------------
* ExtraaLearn is an initial-stage startup that offers programs on cutting-edge technologies to students and professionals to help them upskill/reskill.
* With a large number of leads being generated, one of ExtraaLearn's biggest challenges is to identify which leads are more likely to convert into paying customers, so that the company can allocate resources accordingly.
* As a data scientist in the company, I need to analyze and build an ML model that can identify leads more likely to convert into paying customers, identify factors driving the lead conversion process, and create a profile of leads more likely to convert.

File Structure
----------------
* An ipynb file that contains the Python code used to load the dataset and run exploratory data analysis (EDA). The file also includes charts and data visualization used for univariate and multivariate analyses, and ML model construction. Markdown comments are also included, which detail observations of the results and factors identified for a lead conversion profile.
* A CSV file that contains all the user data collected by ExtraaLearn for the purpose of identifying lead conversion targets.

Results 
----------------
The Jupyter Notebook file contains several data visualizations used for this project. Here are some of the most important charts:

</p>

* This is the feature importance chart generated by the Decision Tree model, which only identified five important features.
* Based on this bar chart, the most important features are time spent on website and having first interaction through the website. Medium profile completion, age, and last activity through website also have importance.
* Meanwhile, the rest of the variables have no impact on deciding whether a lead gets converted or not.

</p>

* This is the confusion matrix for the tuned decision tree model.
* For class 0, the tuned decision tree model has precision of 0.93, recall of 0.77, and F1-score of 0.84.
* For class 1, the tuned decision tree model has precision of 0.62, recall of 0.86, and F1-score of 0.72.
* The evaluation metrics for both the training and testing datasets are very similar to each other. This is great as it reassures us the model is not overfitting.

* This is another feature importance chart generated by the Random Forest model. As you can see, it's more robust than the decision tree model as it detects more important features.
* The top 3 most important features are time spent on the website, first interaction through the website, and medium profile completion.
* Other features with relative importance are age, last activity through phone, leads being unemployed, leads being students, last activity through website, page views per visit, website visits, discovery through educational channels, and low profile completion.

Conclusions
-------------
* Based on both the decision tree and random forest models, the top three most important features are time spent on the website, first interaction through the website, and medium profile completion.
* Based on the class 1 recall scores, the best performing model appears to be the tuned decision tree model, as it has a recall score of 0.86 on the testing data.
* The exploratory data analysis suggests that leads who are most likely to convert into paying customers are people in their 40s or 50s who are either working professionals or unemployed, and have their first interaction with ExtraaLearn through the website.

Recommendations
----------------
* We saw that **time spent on the website and leads having first interaction through the website are the most important factors in converting leads into paying customers**. In order to convert more leads, ExtraaLearn should prioritize the website. The company should push leads to interact with the website first. In addition, ExtraaLearn should also create incentives for leads to stay on the website for as long as possible.
* The company should also expand its efforts in continued lead interactions through the website. This should improve the company's operational efficiency and convert more leads. Continued interaction through email and phone shouldn't be neglected either, as they have decent lead conversion rates.
* ExtraaLearn should also refocus its marketing efforts towards demographics who are most likely to convert. The demographic that should be prioritized is middle-aged individuals (40s and 50s) who are either working professionals or unemployed. With this marketing shift, ExtraaLearn should see a greater return-on-investment with lead conversions.
* ExtraaLearn should also work towards securing more leads through referrals, as they have the greatest conversion rates compared to the other advertisement channels. This can be achieved by creating a professional network made up of program alumni. The other advertisement channels appear to be ineffective as they have little to no impact in converting leads compared to those who have no exposure to a particular advertisement channel.
